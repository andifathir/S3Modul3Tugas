## Project Description
This project consists of three Java programs that perform different tasks. Below is a brief description of each program:

calc.java: This program is a simple calculator that allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It takes two numeric inputs from the user and provides the result of the selected operation.

LayangLayangCalculator.java: This program calculates the area and perimeter of a kite (layang-layang) based on user-provided values. It calculates the area using the lengths of two diagonals and the perimeter using the lengths of two sides.

Main.java: This program asks the user for their age and then displays their age.

## Installation
To run these Java programs, you need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer. You can download and install the JDK from the official Oracle website or an alternative source. After installing the JDK, you can compile and run the Java programs using a Java compiler and the command line.

## Usage
To use the calc.java program, follow these steps:

Compile the program using javac calc.java.
Run the program using java calc.
Follow the on-screen instructions to input two numbers and select an operation.
To use the LayangLayangCalculator.java program, follow these steps:

Compile the program using javac LayangLayangCalculator.java.
Run the program using java LayangLayangCalculator.
Input the values as prompted to calculate the area and perimeter of a rhombus.
To use the Main.java program, follow these steps:

Compile the program using javac Main.java.
Run the program using java Main.
Enter your age when prompted, and the program will display your age.
